      <h1>Our Goal</h1>
      <p>We have devoted ourselves to aid our teachers in supporting our children throughout their prime years of their
        childhood. For the people that have worked hard to provide our children the education, freedom of expression,
        and to nurture a pathway to their future, we have made an organization dedicated to assist teachers with
        supplies requested by them truely.</p>

        <h3>Help teachers help them</h3>
        <p>Our children are the most important people in our lives. If we assist the teachers needs they would be able
          to put their focus up entirely to helping our kids as they grow up and learn. Kids are important to our future.</p>

        <h3>Assist their pockets</h3>
        <p>Our teachers use their own paycheck to buy supplies for our kids. If they had no worries about this, they
          would be able to do activities that would give our kids the most enjoyment and creative liberty.</p>

        <h3>Be apart the community</h3>
        <p>You wouldn't just be helping your kid, but everyone elses in your community. Community support helps
          neighborhoods and areas flourish. Being an active member of your community helps everyone including you.</p>
